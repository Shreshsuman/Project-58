    Coding is a skill where you take instructions (the steps in a task) and translate it into a language the computer understands since computers do not communicate like humans. They communicate in a language called BINARY and it is uses 0's and 1's. Coders write the instructions using a programming language.<br/><br/><br/>Coding is what makes it possible for us to create computer software, apps and websites.
